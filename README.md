Sneezomizer 3000
================

Have you been plagued by the suspicion that you always sneeze a prime number of times
in each sequence? Sneezomizer can help you finally determine if you have this rare
superpower.

If you don't have that particular superpower, Sneezomizer will also help you determine
whether you can at *least* sneeze fibonacci numbers.

Sneezomizer is a JavaScript application written in Scala with [ScalaJS](http://www.scala-js.org/).
There's a demo [here](https://haakonn.github.io/sneezomizer/).
